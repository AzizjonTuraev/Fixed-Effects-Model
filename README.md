# Fixed-Effects-Model

This project replicates a fixed effect model of a paper by Marc Piopiunik and Jens Ruhose's papers of Immigration: Regional Conditions, and Crime: Evidence from an allocation policy in Germany and creates additional models using their dataset, and contains codes to illustrate graphs using immigration-related data.

The dataset of the paper can be also accessible via https://www.sciencedirect.com/cience/article/pii/S0014292116302252#ec0005
